My name is Hans Maes and I've been creating software applications since 2005.

I've written application for a variety of sectors including retail, waste management, motivational solutions and the public domain.
Mostly I specialize in Java (server)applications for medium to large companies using such frameworks as Hibernate,Spring,JSF,...

I'm a firm believer of TDD and the power of coffee.

Currently I'm employed as a freelance consultant for Solid Syntax.
