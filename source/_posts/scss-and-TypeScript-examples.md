I've started working on a front-end project using Angular in combination with the Angular-CLI. By default Angular-CLI scaffolds a project configured to use TypeScript and the (optional) scss-sass css preprocessor.

In order to get a better grip on both technologies I've followed a [scss](https://www.udemy.com/sass-from-beginner-to-advanced/) and [TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/understanding-typescript/) cours on Udemy. For reference all examples and snippets have been added to my GitHub account.
