I've been reading up on how to use [CSS Grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). Which reminded me of how a lot of games in the past used a grid based playing field (e.g. Bomberman,Boulder Dash,...).
So I've decided to get some practice an recreate a basic Snake game using JavaScript and Css Grid layout. 

The code is written  in vanilla JavaScript and CSS. No external libraries or Pre-processors where used.

The source is, as always, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SolidSyntax/css-layouts/tree/master/css-grid-snake).
