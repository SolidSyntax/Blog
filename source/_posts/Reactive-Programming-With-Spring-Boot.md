A few weeks ago I gave a technical talk about the new reactive programming capabilities of the upcoming Spring Boot 2.0 release.

The talk discusses the need for reactive programming  and the current landscape of implementations. You can view the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eVMP1d_JmQbxKnkNXl0ItKbnyJFqXENDu3e7iOLXiyk).

I've created a sample application to accompany the talk. It contains a web application build on [Spring Boot 2.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Release-Notes), the [MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams/) and [Oboe.js](http://oboejs.com/).

The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SolidSyntax/Spring-Reactive-Example).
