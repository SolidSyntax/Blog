Some time ago we upgraded our connection pool from [Apache Commons DBCP](http://commons.apache.org/dbcp/) to [The Tomcat JDBC Connection Pool](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html). We did so mostly because of the improved concurrency handling but soon found out that the addition of [JDBC interceptors](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#JDBC_interceptors) was a useful resource in locating performance issues.
[SlowQueryReport](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.interceptor.SlowQueryReport) is one of the included interceptors. It logs queries which take longer to execute then the specified threshold. 
While this information can be very valuable it doesnâ€™t quite tell the complete story.

It could be that a certain unit of work (a transaction, a method call) doesn't log a single slow query and still takes a long time to complete because it executes a lot of queries. To count the number of queries in a transaction I've created a CountQueryReport extension for the Tomcat JDBC Connection Pool. It is a very simple extension which will count the number of statements (per thread) executed between a call to 'resetCount()' and 'numberOfStatements()'.

Configuration example (for a Spring environment):
{% codeblock lang:xml %}
<bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSource">
    ...
    <!-- Log queries -->
    <property name="jdbcInterceptors" value="net.solidsyntax.jdbc.pool.interceptor.CountQueryReport" />
</bean>
{% endcodeblock %}

Usage in a basic Servlet filter:
{% codeblock lang:java %}
public class CountQueryFilter implements Filter {

    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {}

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {

        //reset the statement counter for the current thread
        CountQueryReport.resetCount();

        //go down the filter chain
        chain.doFilter(request,response);

        //display the number of statement executed
        System.out.println("Number of statements executed: " + CountQueryReport.numberOfStatements());
    }

    public void destroy() {}

}
{% endcodeblock %}
