I'm currently working on a project in which we are re-writing an existing website build on Spring-MVC and JSPs. We decided to jump on the band-wagon and move to a combination of Spring RESTful web services and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

To get some practice I thought I could make a game in AngularJS.

The game is similar to the game [Ghost Blitz](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83195/ghost-blitz) as you need to figure out as quickly as possible which is the correct answer based on elimination. The in-game text is in Dutch but the code is written in English.

You can have a look at the live demo [here](http://solidsyntax.be/playground/DiertjesEnKleurtjes) . The code is available under the GPL license on my GitHub account, which can be found [here](https://github.com/SolidSyntax/AnimalsAndColors). If you have a suggestion feel free to create an issue. Or better yet, create a fork and add whatever you can think of !

Technology used:

*   Webstorm as the IDE of choice. I was very impressed with their CSS/Javascript debugging support. [Spy-JS](http://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2014/04/spy-js-webstorm-secret-service/) saved me a lot of time.
*   The questions were generated by a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) script.
*   [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) was used for boilerplate code.
*   AngularJS is the main-framework.  I added Angular-[Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org/#/) for the layout system, buttons and dialogues.
*   [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) handled dependencies.
I've learned a lot from writing this fun little program, writing a game is a fun way to try out some new technologies. Enjoy the code and enjoy the game.
