I recently had to configure a Tomcat to allow remote access to the JMX service. It involved some configuration to get a connection through the firewall so I've made a [configuration-guide](/connect-to-jmxmbeans-on-tomcat-behind-a-firewall/ "Connect to JMX(MBeans) on Tomcat behind a firewall") for those interested. Be sure to leave some feedback if you've got anything to add !
