Trying to optimize OneToOne mappings by setting the fetch mode to lazy does not always work as expected. I've added a guide about how to [optimize OneToOne mappings ](/optimize-onetoone-mappings/ "Optimize OneToOne mappings"). The guide takes a closer look at how lazy fetching is affected by the owner of a relation.  Enjoy the read.
