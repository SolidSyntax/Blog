I've just finished reading [NoSQL Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Emerging World of Polyglot Persistence](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321826620/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321826620&linkCode=as2&tag=solisynt-20)
NoSQL Distilled is a very concise book of about 150 pages. It's main goal is to give people new to the NoSQL world a high level overview of what NoSQL is all about.

### What can you expect from reading this book:

The book is structured around 2 parts. 
In the first part the authors explain the need for NoSQL solutions. They discuss why a traditional relational database might not always be the right tool and how a NoSQL solution can be a better fit for some types of problems. Building on this the difference between a relational and NoSQL data-model is explained by providing examples in some of the most common NoSQL databases. The focus then shifts on database distribution models and how they impact the consistency of the database.

If the first part puts the focus on the "Why?" then the second part of the books answers the "How?"
The four major types of NoSQL databases are discussed in depth and a comparison is made to the relational database. The authors actually succeed in drawing a nice overview of the benefits and disadvantages between a relational and NoSQL database under specific circumstances.  

### Should you read this book:

If you're a programmer or a DBA who is just getting started with NoSQL, BigData or distributed database environments then this book is a must read. From time to time it might contain some difficult to read sections and overly complicated definitions (It's a Martin Fowler book after all) but in the end it provides a very complete introduction. You should read this book to know what's out there and how it might help your applications. You should not read this book if you've already decided on a NoSQL database and are looking for an in-depth manual. 
And at only 150 pages it should make a fine read during a long weekend.
